# Random Serial Generator
Generates Random Serials

Random Serial Generator 1.0 is a simple application that allows you to generate a random serial number for testing license algorithms or implementing them into your own application.

Features:
1. Predefined Character Sets: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, 0-F, 0-f, 0-9 + A-Z, 0-9 + a-z, and 0-9, A-Z, + a-z.
2. Define a Custom Character Set.
3. Input length in either Decimal or Hexadecimal format.
4. Insert Dashes in Insert or Replace Mode.

I did not add any size limits on the input length, so use large numbers with caution. 

This software is 100% free and open source. It comes with no warranty.
